        <P>
            The dream team came together in late 2017 drawn by each other's desire and passion for programming and information technology.
            Since then, they have talked about numerous projects but have yet to show any work for them.
        </P>

        The team consists of three members:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="alex.php">Alex Lee</a></li>
            <li><a href="steve.php">Steve Cho</a></li>
            <li>
                <a href="henry.php">Henry Ho</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
